1.  Hello, this is a VS 2012 solution with a WebAPI svc project (and sample web page client) and a VS Unit Test project that tests the webapi.

2.  The entire solution was uploaded, so it's a little messy.

3.  To Run:  download and build the ToDoSvc project and it should launch your browser to your local webserver with the default.html page.  This page contains the basic client app to exercise the api.

4.  Click the 'Init Data' button to get some sample data from the api.

5.  Add a new item by typing in the input box and clicking 'Add'.

6.  Click the 'x' button next to each ToDo item to remove it from the list.
